                He knew what he was supposed to do. That had been apparent from the beginning. That was what 
                made the choice so difficult. What he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the same.
                This would have been fine if he were willing to face the inevitable consequences, but he wasn't.
            </p>

                It was the best compliment that he'd ever received although the person who gave it likely never knew. 
                It had been an off-hand observation on his ability to hold a conversation and actually add pertinent 
                information to it on practically any topic. Although he hadn't consciously strived to be able to do so,
                he'd started to voraciously read the news when he couldn't keep up on topics his friends discussed because 
                their conversations is above his head.

                Debbie knew she was being selfish and unreasonable. She understood why the others in the room were angry and frustrated 
                with her and the way she was acting. In her eyes, it didn't really matter how they felt because she simply didn't care.
            </p>
            <p>
                The spot was perfect for camouflage. She couldn't imagine that anyone would ever be able to see her in these surroundings.
                 So there she sat, confident that she was hidden from the world and safe from danger. Unfortunately, she had not anticipated that others may be looking upon her from other angles, and now they were stealthily descending toward her hiding spot.
