                Green vines attached to the trunk of the tree had wound themselves toward the top of the canopy. 
                Ants used the vine as their private highway, avoiding all the creases and crags of the bark, 
                to freely move at top speed from top to bottom or bottom to top depending on their current chore. 
                At least this was the way it was supposed to be. Something had damaged the vine overnight halfway 
                up the tree leaving a gap in the once pristine ant highway.

                Devon couldn't figure out the color of her eyes. He initially would have guessed that they were green,
                but the more he looked at them he almost wanted to say they were a golden yellow. Then there were the
                flashes of red and orange that seemed to be streaked throughout them. It was almost as if her eyes were 
                made of opal with the sun constantly glinting off of them and bringing out more color. They were definitely 
                the most unusual pair of eyes he'd ever seen.
