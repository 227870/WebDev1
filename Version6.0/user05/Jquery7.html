        <p>
            The missile knows where it is at all times.
            It knows this because it know where it isn't.
            By subtracting where it is from where it isn't,
            or where it isn't from where it is, whichever
            is greater, it obtains a difference, or deviation.

            How much wood would a woodchuck chuck
            if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
            He would chuck, he would, as much as he could,
            and chuck as much wood as a woodchuck would
            if a woodchuck could chuck wood.
