            Now we are know who they are, what's the meaning of their name and now we will jump into the history of their winning.
        </p>

        <h3>
            <ins>1960s</ins>
        </h3>

        <p>
             The Vikings won their first regular-season game, defeating the Chicago Bears 37-13 on Opening Day 1961,
             Reality set in as the expansion team lost its next seven games on their way to a 3-11 record.
             The losing continued throughout much of the 1960s as the Vikings had a combined record of 32 wins, 59 losses, and 7 ties in their first seven seasons with only one winning season (8-5-1 in 1964).
        </p>

        <p>
            In 1969, the Vikings secured a 12-2 record. The team had 12 straight regular-season victories after a season-opening loss to the New York Giants, 
            which was the longest single-season winning streak in 35 years. The Vikings defeated the Cleveland Browns 27-7 in the last pre-merger NFL Championship Game on January 4, 1970, at Metropolitan Stadium. 
            The Vikings became the first modern NFL expansion team to win an NFL Championship Game, and earned a berth in Super Bowl IV.
        </p>

        <p>
            Philadelphia Eagles assistant Nick Skorich and a man with Minnesota ties who was working in the CFL, Bud Grant, were also candidates until a different Eagle, quarterback Norm Van Brocklin, was hired on January 18, 1961. 
            Van Brocklin had just finished his career as a player on a high note, having defeated the Green Bay Packers in the 1960 NFL Championship Game.

        <p>
            Just a bit of a biography about the crazy win and the coach of the Vikings team in the early 60's. 
            What I want to avoid is that I don't want the user to feel <u><mark>bored and sleepy</mark></u> when reading more than 5 pages of the calendar about history of a certain team playing football.
            I'm pretty sure that you already yawning after reading done this sentences or yawn during reading the paragraph above.
