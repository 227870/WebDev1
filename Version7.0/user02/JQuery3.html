      <h1>My Summary</h1>
      <p>
       Ten-year-old Harry Potter is an orphan who lives in the fictional London 
       suburb of Little Whinging, Surrey, with the Dursleys: his uncaring Aunt 
       Petunia, loathsome Uncle Vernon, and spoiled cousin Dudley. The Dursleys 
       barely tolerate Harry, and Dudley bullies him. One day Harry is astonished 
       to receive a letter addressed to him in the cupboard under the stairs 
       (where he sleeps). Before he can open the letter, however, Uncle Vernon 
       takes it. Letters for Harry subsequently arrive each day, in increasing 
       numbers, but Uncle Vernon tears them all up, and finally, in an attempt 
       to escape the missives, the Dursleys go to a miserable shack on a small 
       island. On Harry’s 11th birthday, a giant named Hagrid arrives and reveals 
       that Harry is a wizard and that he has been accepted at the Hogwarts 
       School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He also sheds light on Harry’s past, 
       informing the boy that his parents, a wizard and a witch, were killed 
       by the evil wizard Voldemort and that Harry acquired the lightning-bolt 
       scar on his forehead during the fatal confrontation.

          Upon arrival at the school, the students are sorted into one of four houses—Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or 
          Slytherin. Harry ends up in Gryffindor, and during his eventful first year at Hogwarts he becomes close friends with 
          two other members of the house, Ron Weasley, who comes from an old wizarding family, and Hermione Granger, whose parents 
          are Muggles (those who are not magical). Harry also finds that he has an enemy in Draco Malfoy (Slytherin). In addition, 
          Harry’s prowess in flying on a broomstick makes him a star of Gryffindor’s Quidditch team. Hoping to get Harry and his 
          friends into trouble, Draco tricks them into leaving their rooms one night, a violation of school rules. While trying to 
          avoid being caught, 
          My friend once called a few house painters to his house for some work. 
          He wanted them to paint his porch. After a few hours, the house painters 
          came back for the payment as their work was complete. Before leaving they 
          told my friend that they had enjoyed painting his car, but it is not really a Porsche.
