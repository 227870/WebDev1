    Greg? Mmm. Greg? What? Greg ! Huh? What? What are you doing? Get up! Mom and Dad have been calling you for an hour.
     You're about to be late for your first day of middle school. What? Oh, geez! How did that happen? Go, go, go! 
     Mom's about to flip out! She sent me to get you while she waits in the car! What are you doing? What's going on? 
     Getting ready for. . . . . .school. Are you insane? School doesn't start till next week. And, FYl, school doesn't 
     start at 4:00 in the morning ! You woke up Manny. And if he doesn't go back down. . . Good morning ! There is no 
     way he is going back down. l just wanted to sleep till 6:00. Bubby! Go to bed. l got him. Greg, what are you doing 
     up making all this noise? lt was Rodrick! He woke me up! He changed my clock! But l swear, he was just. . . Go to bed. 
     What is that smell? l can't even identify it. Bubby! Happy Birthday! Here, Bubby. Wow! Look at the size of that flamethrower! 
     Okay, first of all, let me get something straight. This is a journal, not a diary. Yeah, l know what it says on the cover. 
     But when my mom went out to buy this thing, l specifically told her not to buy one that said "diary" on it. 
     This just proves Mom doesn't understand anything about kids my age. Huh? Sissy! The only reason l agreed to write 
     in this thing is because when l'm rich and famous l'll have better things to do than answer people's stupid 
     questions all day long. Gregory, tell us about your childhood ! Were you always so smart and handsome? Here's 
     my journal. Now, shoo, shoo. That's our boy up there. Why did l ever say no to him?

</p>

    Mom got me this thing so l could write down my feelings about starting middle school. But l'm gonna be fine. 
    lt's my best friend, Rowley Jefferson, l'm worried about. He's definitely not middle school ready. Geronimo! 
    He's not quite clear on the concept of growing up. l want a puppy, a kitty, a gumball machine. . . But anyway, 
    this is about me, not Rowley. l always figured they'd make a movie about my life. But l didn't think they'd start the story 
    here. Because, seriously, who wants to see a movie about a kid who's stuck in middle school with a bunch of morons? Three 
    days, no shower. Smell the love! Let me go, Rodrick! Come on. We're just having some fun, right? No, okay. So, look. Mom asked me 
    to give you some advice about middle school. lt's real simple. Don't talk to anyone. Don't look at anyone. Don't go anywhere. 
    Don't sit down. Don't raise your hand. Don't go to the bathroom. Don't get noticed. Don't choose the wrong locker. Don't. . . 
    Who am l kidding? You'll be dead or homeschooled by the end of the year, anyway. And don't be seen with Rowley. Manny, 
    stop it! Mom ! Thanks for the eggs, Mom. Frank? Greg? l think it's gross and undignified that l have to eat breakfast next 
    to him on the potty. Okay, well, it's your fault he's still potty training. Don't look down, Manny. The potty monster doesn't 
    like it when you look at him. l was just joking with him. Okay. Kiss him you're sorry and then let's get a move on. Can't be 
    late for your first day of school. Let me just say for the record that I think middle school may be the dumbest idea ever invented. 
    You got kids like me who haven't hit their growth spurt yet mixed in with gorillas who have to shave twice a day. There's 
    juvenile delinquents and weirdos. I'm smaIIer than about 95% of the kids at my school...
